# About me

My name is Amr Abouelmagd. I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Tennessee Technological University (4.0 GPA) with a passion for high-performance computing, systems optimization, and distributed systems. My research focuses on GPU performance analysis, particularly on AMD MI300A architectures.

With nearly 3 years of industry experience as a Software Engineer at Incorta, I've delivered significant performance improvementsâ€”achieving up to 7x speedups and 20% cost reductions through innovative caching and optimization strategies.
