## 👋 About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Tennessee Technological University (4.0 GPA) with a passion for high-performance computing, systems optimization, and distributed systems. My research focuses on GPU performance analysis, particularly on AMD MI300A architectures, where I investigate partitioning modes, memory bandwidth, and scheduling behaviors.

With nearly 3 years of industry experience as a Software Engineer at Incorta, I've delivered significant performance improvements—achieving up to 7x speedups and 20% cost reductions through innovative caching and optimization strategies.
