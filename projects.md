## High-Performance Computing Projects

### Parallelized Game of Life
**Technologies**: C++, MPI, Kokkos  
**Focus**: Distributed & Parallel Computing

#### Overview
Developed a highly scalable implementation of Conway's Game of Life using a 2D domain decomposition strategy. This project demonstrates expertise in both distributed and shared-memory parallel programming paradigms.

#### Key Features
- **Distributed Communication**: Leveraged MPI for efficient cross-node message passing and boundary exchange
- **On-Node Parallelism**: Utilized Kokkos for portable performance across different architectures (CPUs, GPUs)
- **2D Decomposition**: Implemented efficient domain partitioning for load balancing
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale from single workstations to large HPC clusters

#### Technical Highlights
- Ghost cell exchange using non-blocking MPI communication
- Performance-portable code that runs on multiple architectures
- Optimized memory access patterns for cache efficiency
- Strong and weak scaling analysis

## Distributed Systems Projects

### Distributed Word Matcher
**Technologies**: Go  
**Course**: Princeton University - Distributed Systems  
**Focus**: Concurrency & Parallel Processing

#### Overview
Implemented an efficient distributed system for identifying the most common words across large text corpora using Go's concurrency primitives.

#### Technical Implementation

- **Channels**: Used for safe communication between workers
- **Work Distribution**: Implemented dynamic load balancing across workers
- **Aggregation**: Efficient merging of results from multiple workers

#### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Go concurrency patterns (fan-out/fan-in)
- Channel-based synchronization
- Work stealing for load balancing
- Race-free concurrent map access

#### Performance Results
- Linear speedup with number of workers (up to hardware limit)
- Efficient CPU utilization across all cores
- Minimal synchronization overhead
